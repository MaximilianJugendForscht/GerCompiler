#GerCompiler - A simple, german Linux-Compiler
--Made as extension to GerInterpreter (www.sites.google.com/site/gerinterpreter) 
--GerInterpreter has more Commands, use it as long, as my Project isn't finished :)

SETUP: To compile the sources, you'll need Lazarus-Pascal (www.lazarus.org).

#Possible Commands:


//These types of comments are legal
schreiben ("Text") //This writes the Text given in " </br>
schreiben (nzeile) //This writes a new Line </br>
schreiben (varname) //writes the variable </br> </br>

neuevariable (var1 = "HI") //creates a new string-variable with the Value of HI </br>
neuvariable (var2 = 42) //Creates a new Integer-Variable with the Answer to life (42) </br>
//Note, that Integer-variables aren't writeable due to a Unicode-glitch </br>
 </br>
punktsetzen (punkt1) //sets a goto-Label </br>
gehezu (punkt1) //goto </br>
 </br>

Please give me some Feedback, but don't post direct Answers to my Questions, as I prefer working alone at this school Project </br> (I'm in the 8th school-year)
 </br>
HAVE FUN USING IT!
