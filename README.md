#GerCompiler - A simple, german, lightweigth Linux-Compiler
--Made as extension to GerInterpreter (www.sites.google.com/site/gerinterpreter) </br>
--GerInterpreter has more Commands, use it as long, as my Project isn't finished :)</br>

SETUP: To compile the sources, you'll need Lazarus-Pascal (www.lazarus-ide.org).</br>

If you directly want to start the Compiler, use the StartCompiler.sh script, which sets-up everything nicely.</br>
PLEASE, DON'T upload Files, as this is a Project I want to drive by my own (until my Project is done)
 
 To know, what the program can do, browse up the WIKI

The executable is in the same folder, as your source-code. Run it in the Terminal with ./programm


Please give me some Feedback, but don't post direct Answers to my Questions, </br>as I prefer working alone at this school Project </br> (I'm in the 8th school-year)
 </br>
HAVE FUN USING IT!
