#GerCompiler - A simple, german, lightweigth Linux-Compiler
--Made as extension to GerInterpreter (www.sites.google.com/site/gerinterpreter) </br>
--GerInterpreter has more Commands, use it as long, as my Project isn't finished :)</br>

SETUP: To compile the sources, you'll need Lazarus-Pascal (www.lazarus-ide.org).</br>

To directly use the executable, use the script, or run

    
    sudo chmod +x /Compiler
    sudo ./Compiler

Please give me some Feedback, but don't post direct Answers to my Questions, </br>as I prefer working alone at this school Project </br>
 </br>
HAVE FUN USING IT!
